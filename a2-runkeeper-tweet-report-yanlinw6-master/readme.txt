4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I asked the professor about how to call functions from tweet.ts to about.js. I realized that 
I was actually calling the functions correctly and it's all about the live server's fault for not updating.

I also asked the professor about vega-lite encoding rotate text

I did all the remaining parts by myself and did some online searches for the parts I am not familiar with.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
1. tsc --p tsconfig.json --watch
2. live server on VScode.
